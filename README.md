# Snyk Infrastructure as Code Demo

This repository contains a hello world example which demonstrates the Terraform features of Snyk Infrastructure as code.

It's specifically updated from the original to supplement deployment on A Cloud Gurus playground, but can be used for all use cases as covered by the other terraform-goof repositories available. 

Internal Snyk users can find the accompanying guide in Confluence.
